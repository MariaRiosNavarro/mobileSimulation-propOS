### Introduction to PropOS (Mobile Simulation OS)


Simulation of a mobile phone operating system, for use in film shoots. The core of the App is the contact list, where you can manage contacts and simulate calls and messages. In the settings you can choose a light, dark or customisable profile. There is also a photo gallery as well as a digital assistant through artificial intelligence (Open AI).
